I successfully presented my Master’s thesis titled *Environmental Justice Assessment of Urban Flood Risk in Seoul Using Machine Learning and Intelligent Dasymetric Mapping* to the professors and students of the Geography Department at Kyungpook National University. The presentation marked a significant milestone in my graduate studies, providing an opportunity to share my research findings with an academic audience.

I am sincerely grateful for the thoughtful questions and constructive feedback offered by the committee members. Their insights will be instrumental in further strengthening the content and analytical depth of my thesis as I move toward its final submission.
