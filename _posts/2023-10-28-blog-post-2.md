I had the opportunity to present my research paper titled *Assessing Urban Flood Susceptibility Maps Based on Machine Learning Models in Seoul, South Korea* at the **32nd Annual Conference of the Geographic Information System Association (GISA) and the International Association of Geo-informatics (IAG’i)**. The conference was held at The University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo, Japan, on October 28–29, 2023.

This presentation, drawn from my Master’s thesis, explores the use of logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine models to generate and evaluate flood susceptibility maps in Seoul. The models were trained and tested using a flood inventory of 2,000 geolocated points and 16 conditioning factors related to topography, hydrology, and infrastructure. Among the models, the random forest approach demonstrated the highest performance, with an accuracy of 0.837 and an AUC of 0.902. Key contributing variables included sewer pipe density, proximity to storm drains, elevation, rainfall, and terrain ruggedness.

Presenting this work allowed me to exchange ideas with experts in geospatial technologies and urban hazard analysis. I am grateful to the conference organizers for providing a platform to engage with such a diverse and knowledgeable academic community.
