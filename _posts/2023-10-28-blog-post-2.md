I had the opportunity to present my research paper titled *Assessing Urban Flood Susceptibility Maps Based on Machine Learning Models in Seoul, South Korea* at the **32nd Annual Conference of the Geographic Information System Association (GISA) and the International Association of Geo-informatics (IAG’i)**. The conference was held at The University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo, Japan, on October 28–29, 2023.

This presentation is part of my Master’s thesis and focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to assess urban flood susceptibility in Seoul. It was a valuable experience to share my findings with fellow researchers and professionals in the field of geoinformatics and to engage in insightful discussions on geospatial technologies and hazard mapping.

I would like to thank the organizers for hosting a well-structured international conference and for the opportunity to participate in such a vibrant academic exchange.

### Abstract 
> This study assessed flood susceptibility maps using logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM) models in Seoul metropolitan city, South Korea. We constructed a flood inventory map consisting of 1,000 flood points and 1,000 non-flood points. These datasets were randomly divided into training and testing datasets in a 70:30 ratio. In addition, we selected 16 variables as flood conditioning factors considering previous literature and data availability. Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, kappa, and AUC were computed to comprehensively evaluate the models' accuracy and predictive capabilities. The resulting flood susceptibility map was classified into five categories, ranging from very low to very high susceptibility. By comparing the evaluation metrics for each model, we concluded that the RF model outperformed the LR and SVM models, exhibiting an accuracy of 0.837 and an AUC of 0.902. Furthermore, our findings highlighted that the most significant flood conditioning variables were sewer pipe density, distance to storm drain, elevation, rainfall, and terrain ruggedness index.
