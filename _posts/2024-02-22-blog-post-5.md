As summer graduation approaches, I’m proud to share that I have officially completed my Master’s degree in Geography at Kyungpook National University.

This achievement would not have been possible without the incredible support I received along the way. To my professors, department staff, and fellow students in the Department of Geography—thank you for your guidance, encouragement, and collaborative spirit throughout my academic journey. I also extend my sincere appreciation to the Office of International Affairs for their assistance during my stay in South Korea.

I am especially grateful to the National Institute for International Education (NIIED) for granting me the opportunity to study under the Global Korea Scholarship (GKS) Program. This scholarship enabled me to pursue my studies and immerse myself in Korean culture and academic life.

To my family—thank you for standing by me from the day I submitted my application until the final days of writing my thesis. Your love and support have carried me through every step of this journey.
