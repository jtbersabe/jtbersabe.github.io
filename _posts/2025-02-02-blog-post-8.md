This study evaluates and maps pluvial flood susceptibility across Seoul using three machine learning models, with a particular focus on integrating drainage-related datasets alongside traditional flood conditioning factors. Our results show that incorporating drainage infrastructure data significantly improves model performance and enhances the spatial accuracy of flood susceptibility predictions.

The findings contribute valuable insights to ongoing discussions on urban flood risk reduction, offering actionable guidance for urban planners, policymakers, and disaster management professionals. The study underscores the need to integrate hydrological and infrastructural data in flood modeling to better prepare cities for extreme rainfall events and to design more resilient urban environments.

I welcome future discussions and collaborations on advancing urban flood resilience through geospatial research.
