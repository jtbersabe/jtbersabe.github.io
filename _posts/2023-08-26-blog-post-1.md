From August 22 to 25, I had the opportunity to attend the first-ever Spatial Information Education Program for Foreign Students hosted by the LX Education Institute in Gongju, South Korea.

As someone who primarily used ArcGIS in spatial data analysis, this program was my introduction to QGIS, a powerful open-source GIS software. The course covered fundamental topics ranging from data integration to raster analysis—valuable tools for students across diverse academic disciplines. I was particularly impressed by QGIS’s accessibility and versatility, making it a great entry point for anyone interested in geospatial technologies.

Since this was the pilot run of the program, the content was focused on foundational concepts. However, LX Education Institute plans to expand the program in the coming years to include more advanced topics and attract a broader group of international participants.

I encourage fellow foreign students in Korea who are interested in learning about spatial information systems to apply for this program. Further information and application details are available on the LX Education Institute’s website.
