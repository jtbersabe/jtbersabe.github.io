I had the opportunity to present my poster titled “Exploring Spatially Varying Relationships between Basement Homes in Flood Risk Areas and Vulnerable Population in Seoul” at the 2023 Fall Conference of the Korean Association of Geographic Information Studies (KAGIS), held on November 9 at Jeju National University.

The study investigates the spatial distribution of basement residences exposed to flood risks in Seoul and their association with vulnerable populations. Using Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis, OLS regression, and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), the research revealed a significant positive relationship between flood-prone basement housing and the foreigner population. The spatial variation in these patterns underscores the intersection of urban flood exposure and socioeconomic inequality.

This presentation was an invaluable opportunity to engage with fellow researchers and gain feedback on incorporating spatial statistics into environmental justice research. I’m grateful to the KAGIS community for fostering such a thoughtful and collaborative academic environment.
