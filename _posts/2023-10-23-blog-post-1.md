I had the amazing opportunity to share my research at the 15th Korea-China-Japan Joint Geography Conference, held at The University of Seoul, South Korea, from October 20-23, 2023. 

I'm thrilled to share that I received the Young Geographers Award for Best Paper Presentation at this conference. This was my first time doing an oral presentation, and I'm grateful to my adviser for their guidance and to the conference organizers for honoring me with this award. Thank you all!
