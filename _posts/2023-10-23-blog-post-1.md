I had the honor of presenting my paper, *Estimating the Populations Vulnerable to Flood Risk in Seoul Using Dasymetric Mapping and Integrated Flooding Data* at the **15th Korea-China-Japan Joint Geography Conference**, held at the University of Seoul from October 20 to 23, 2023.

This was my first oral presentation at an international academic conference, and it was a meaningful opportunity to share my research and engage with geographers from across East Asia. I am sincerely grateful to my academic adviser for their continuous mentorship and support.

I was also humbled to receive the **Young Geographers Award** for Best Paper Presentation. My heartfelt thanks to the organizing committee for this recognition and for facilitating such a dynamic and collaborative environment.
