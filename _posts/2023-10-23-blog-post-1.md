I had the honor of presenting my paper, *Estimating the Populations Vulnerable to Flood Risk in Seoul Using Dasymetric Mapping and Integrated Flooding Data* at the **15th Korea-China-Japan Joint Geography Conference**, held at the University of Seoul from October 20 to 23, 2023.

This was my first oral presentation at an international academic conference, and it was a valuable opportunity to share my work with geographers from across East Asia. My study combines dasymetric mapping techniques with integrated flooding datasets—such as 100-year flood risk maps and historical inundation records—to more accurately estimate the population vulnerable to flooding in Seoul.

The findings show that traditional methods like areal weighting and centroid-containment can misrepresent flood-exposed population estimates by 9% and 3%, respectively, when compared to dasymetric mapping. The analysis also reveals distinct spatial patterns in vulnerability: marginalized populations in southern districts near the Han River and foreign residents in flood-prone zones north of the river.

I’m deeply grateful for the mentorship of my academic adviser and honored to have received the **Young Geographers Award for Best Paper Presentation**. My sincere thanks to the organizing committee for facilitating such an enriching academic exchange.
