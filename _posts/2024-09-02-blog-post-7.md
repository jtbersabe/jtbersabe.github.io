I am excited to share that this semester marks the beginning of a new chapter in my academic journey as I begin my Ph.D. in Geography at Kyungpook National University, supported by the prestigious Global Korea Scholarship (GKS) from the National Institute for International Education (NIIED).

As a two-time recipient of the GKS, I am honored to be selected as one of approximately 1,800 scholars worldwide this year. This recognition not only celebrates the academic work I have accomplished so far but also brings with it a deep sense of responsibility to contribute meaningfully through research and scholarship.

My doctoral research will focus on urban disasters, a growing global concern as cities continue to expand and confront the increasing impacts of climate change and natural hazards. I aim to investigate how disaster risks affect urban populations—especially the most vulnerable—and to explore strategies for risk reduction and resilience-building through scientific research and policy recommendations.

With the support of this scholarship, I hope to contribute to the development of data-informed, equitable disaster response and preparedness systems. I am grateful to Kyungpook National University and NIIED for this invaluable opportunity and look forward to collaborating with scholars and professionals dedicated to safer, more resilient urban futures.
