### Abstract: 
The unprecendented rainfall event in August 2022 had devastating consequences in Seoul, particularly in areas of Gangnam-gu and Gwanak-gu. This study delves into the socioeconomic characteristics of individuals residing in basement homes located within flood risk zones in Seoul. The investigation employs Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot analysis, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models. The findings of this research indicates a statistically significant and positive correlation between the foreigner popuilation and flood-exposed basement homes in Seoul. Furthermore, disparities in flood-exposed basement residences are observed across various neighborhoods within the city. These results are contextualized within the framework of existing socioeconomic inequalities in Seoul, emphasizing areas where disparities in urban flooding and basement residences are most pronouced. The implications of this study are far-reaching, providing valuable insights for the intergraion of socioeconomic variables in the formulation and implementation of effective housing policies and subsidies.
